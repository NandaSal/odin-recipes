    <!-- ingredients - header 3 -->
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>2-3 tablespoons of butter</li>
        <li>1-3 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>A source of heat, like red pepper flakes, or szechuan peppers</li>
        <li>A source of spice OR a source of sweetness, such as dijon mustard or honey</li>
        <li>A source of herbiness, like oregano, thyme, sage, rosemary, etc in any combination that goes well together or on its own</li>
        <li>2 slices of your preferred bread type</li>
        <li>1-3 types of cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Steps - header 3 -->
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Take your garlic cloves and crush them either with the meat of your palm or the flat of a knife, or literally anything that would crush well. Take your bread slices and put a source of spice or sweetness if you are using one. Take a pan and put it on the stove on low-medium heat (a.k.a. a 2 out of 10).
        </li>

        <li>
            Place the butter in the pan, as well as the garlic cloves, the source of heat, and the source of herbiness.
        </li>

        <li>
            The butter will melt in the pan and soak up the ingredients that you also put into the pan. Take each slice of bread and place it in the pan to butter it, OR just take one slice, place the cheese on it, and then put the other bread on.
        </li>

        <li>
            When the bread is in the pan, turn it up to medium heat (5 out of 10) and just let it sit for a bit. When you can see the cheese start to get visibly melty - or when you vibecheck it - flip it once and just do the same thing.
        </li>

        <li>
            When you've grilled your cheese on both sides, take it out of the pan and it's ready.
        </li>
    </ol>
