    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This is the simplest, easiest way I've ever found to make the typical brazilian snack p達o de queijo.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>200g of heavy cream</li>

        <li>1 teacup of grated Mozzarela cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            In a recipient, add all of the ingredients and mix them together. If the dough is too sticky, you can add more starch. The end result should still be a somewhat sticky.
        </li>

        <li>
            You can use a bit of butter on your hands to make little balls with the dough and set them aside on a tray (that has been greased). Make sure the small balls are spread apart so they don't become one when cooked (they will grow).
        </li>

        <li>
            Put the tray with the rolls in the oven at 180 degrees for around 40 minutes or until done.
        </li>
    </ol>
